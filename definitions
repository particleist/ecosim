income = expenditures = production (abstract from foreign trade)

income = basic income + compensations + profits = expenditures = production

income = consumption + savings

basic income = consumption

profits = savings = investments

compensations = consumption + savings

profits = constant share of income

basic income = constant share of compensations (e.g. wages)

basic income = taxes

taxes = percent of compensations + percent of profits (they could be collected indirectly, i.e. via VAT)

production = consumption + savings (investment)

growth of production = growth of population + growth of productivity

Rawlsian criterion of inequality = basic income should be financed from Pigou taxes on compensation (tax on rent called ability)
and on profits (to the extent that it is a rent on ownership). 

All taxes cover basic income plus public goods (security etc.). Additional question is social security
(health, education, other types of dependence; no fund for unemployed, however).

Key point 1: More income (because of basic income) = more production

Key point 2: Pigue taxation (taxing income that is a kind of a rent, so it does not affect behaviour, i.e. incentive to
work or save and invest).
